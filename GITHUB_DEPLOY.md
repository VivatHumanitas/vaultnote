# ðŸš€ Deploy VaultNote to GitHub

Your GitHub repository is ready: **https://github.com/VivatHumanitas/vaultnote**

## Push Your Code to GitHub

Run these commands in the Shell:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: VaultNote encrypted document vault with automated APK building"
git remote add origin https://github.com/VivatHumanitas/vaultnote.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## What Happens Next

âœ… **Automatic APK Building**
- GitHub Actions will automatically start building your APK
- Build takes about 30-60 minutes (first time downloads Android SDK/NDK)
- Every future push triggers a new build automatically

## Download Your APK

1. Go to: **https://github.com/VivatHumanitas/vaultnote/actions**
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Scroll to "Artifacts" section
4. Download `vaultnote-apk`
5. Extract the `.apk` file
6. Install on your Android device!

## Monitor Build Progress

- **Actions Tab**: https://github.com/VivatHumanitas/vaultnote/actions
- **Green checkmark** = Build successful âœ“
- **Red X** = Build failed (check logs)
- **Yellow circle** = Build in progress...

## Create a Release (Optional)

To create a tagged release with automatic APK attachment:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The APK will be automatically attached to the release at:
**https://github.com/VivatHumanitas/vaultnote/releases**

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**
- Check the Actions logs for specific errors
- Most common: missing dependencies (already configured in workflow)
- Contact if you need help debugging

**Can't push to GitHub?**
```bash
git remote -v  # Check remote is set correctly
git status     # Check for uncommitted changes
```

## Future Updates

Every time you make changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

GitHub Actions will automatically build a fresh APK!
