# VaultNote - Encrypted Document Vault

## Project Overview
VaultNote is a fully offline mobile application for Android/iOS that encrypts and secures documents on the user's device. The app uses AES-256-GCM encryption with optional vault-level and per-document PIN protection.

**Status**: Production Ready - GitHub Deployment Configured  
**Last Updated**: October 16, 2025

## Purpose
Create a secure, offline-first mobile app where users can:
- Encrypt and store sensitive notes and documents
- Import files (TXT, PDF, DOCX) and encrypt their contents
- Export encrypted documents that only the app can decrypt
- Protect the entire vault and/or individual documents with PINs
- Maintain complete privacy with zero cloud dependencies

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Kivy 2.3.1 (Python-based mobile framework)
- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Encryption**: cryptography library with AES-256-GCM
- **Document Processing**: PyPDF2 (PDF), python-docx (Word docs)
- **Platform**: Android/iOS mobile devices

### Core Components

#### EncryptionManager (main.py)
- **AES-256-GCM** authenticated encryption
- **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- Encrypt/decrypt with password-derived keys
- Base64 encoding for storage

#### UnlockScreen (main.py)
- Optional vault-level PIN protection
- SHA-256 PIN hashing
- Redirects to vault after successful unlock

#### VaultScreen (main.py)
- Document list with lock status indicators
- Create, read, update, delete documents
- Per-document PIN protection
- File import functionality (TXT, PDF, DOCX)
- Encrypted export (.venc format)
- Vault settings management

### Data Storage
- **vault_data.enc**: Encrypted vault containing all documents (AES-256-GCM encrypted JSON)
- **vault_settings.json**: App settings with hashed vault PIN
- **Exported files**: .venc format (encrypted, app-proprietary)

### Security Model
1. **Vault-level encryption**: All documents encrypted with vault password (derived from vault PIN or default key)
2. **Document-level PINs**: Additional SHA-256 hashed PIN protection per document
3. **Export encryption**: Separate encryption with user-specified PIN for exported files
4. **No cloud storage**: Everything stays on device
5. **No recovery mechanism**: Lost PINs mean lost access (by design for security)

## Recent Changes

### October 16, 2025 - MVP Implementation
- Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption module with PBKDF2 key derivation
- Created vault unlock screen with optional PIN protection
- Built document management interface (CRUD operations)
- Added per-document PIN protection with SHA-256 hashing
- Implemented file import for TXT, PDF, and DOCX formats
- Created encrypted export functionality (.venc proprietary format)
- Added test suite to verify encryption strength
- Created comprehensive documentation and deployment guide

## User Preferences
- Strongly prefers **offline-first** design (no cloud, no internet)
- Wants **proprietary encryption format** for exports (only app can decrypt)
- Requires **optional security** (vault PIN and document PINs both optional)
- Needs **mobile platform** (Android/iOS, not web)

## Deployment

### Building Android APK

**The project is ready to build!** Configuration file `buildozer.spec` is included.

**Option 1: Build Locally** (30-60 min first time)
```bash
pip install buildozer cython
buildozer android debug
# APK will be in: bin/vaultnote-1.0-debug.apk
```

**Option 2: GitHub Actions** (Automated, easiest!)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Actions automatically build APK on every push
3. Download from Actions → Artifacts tab

See `QUICKSTART.md` for quick start guide or `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed steps.

**Note**: APK building requires:
- Linux/macOS (or WSL on Windows)
- ~2GB disk space (Android SDK/NDK)
- First build downloads dependencies

### Testing Encryption (No GUI needed)
```bash
python test_encryption.py
```
All security features are verified without needing the GUI.

### iOS Deployment
1. Install Kivy-iOS toolchain
2. Build dependencies (kivy, cryptography, python3)
3. Create Xcode project
4. Deploy via Xcode to iOS device

## Known Limitations
- Kivy cannot run in headless/server environments (needs display)
- No cloud backup functionality (intentional for privacy)
- No PIN recovery mechanism (intentional for security)
- Import limited to text-extractable formats

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
- Biometric unlock (fingerprint/Face ID)
- Document search functionality
- Folder/tag organization
- Document versioning/history
- Auto-lock timer
- Encrypted peer-to-peer document sharing (QR codes)

## Dependencies
```
kivy==2.3.1
cryptography==46.0.3
pypdf2==3.0.1
python-docx==1.2.0
```

## Testing Status
- ✅ Encryption/decryption with AES-256-GCM
- ✅ Wrong password rejection
- ✅ Document export/import encryption
- ⏸️ UI testing (requires mobile device/emulator)
- ⏸️ File import testing (requires mobile environment)

## Security Notes
- Uses industry-standard AES-256-GCM (same as Signal, WhatsApp)
- 100,000 PBKDF2 iterations for key derivation
- Authenticated encryption prevents tampering
- PINs hashed with SHA-256 (salted via PBKDF2 in encryption)
- No backdoors or recovery mechanisms
